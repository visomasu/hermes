Register users to receive daily SLA violation notifications for their work items and direct reports.

## Trigger
User requests: "register for SLA", "sign me up for SLA", "enable SLA notifications", "start tracking SLAs", "register for work item notifications"

## Process

**1. Identify User Intent**
Parse user input for registration keywords. Confirm intent if ambiguous.

**2. Execute Registration**
Call: `UserManagementTool.Execute("RegisterSlaNotifications", {"teamsUserId": "<user_id>"})`

This automatically:
- Fetches user's Azure AD email via Microsoft Graph
- Determines if user is a manager (has direct reports)
- Retrieves direct report emails for managers
- Stores registration in UserConfiguration
- Enables SLA violation notifications

**3. Communicate Result**
For managers:
"✅ Registered successfully! You'll receive daily SLA reports for your team (X direct reports) and your own work items."

For individual contributors:
"✅ Registered successfully! You'll receive daily SLA reports for your work items."

## Manager vs IC Behavior

**Manager (has direct reports):**
- Receives ONE daily digest with violations from entire team
- Digest grouped by owner email
- Shows manager's own violations separately from team violations
- Detailed view for teams ≤5 people, aggregated view for larger teams

**Individual Contributor (no direct reports):**
- Receives daily digest with only their own violations
- Focused on their assigned work items

## Important Notes

- Registration is automatic via Microsoft Graph API (no manual email entry)
- Manager status derived from direct reports in Azure AD
- Notifications respect quiet hours and throttling rules (NotificationGate)
- Users can check SLA violations on-demand anytime (without registration)
- Silent registration: direct reports are not notified when manager registers

## Error Handling

"Could not retrieve your email from Azure AD. Please contact support."

If registration fails:
"An error occurred during registration. Please try again later."
