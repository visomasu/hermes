Discover and summarize user activity across Azure DevOps and integrated services, including pull requests created by the user.

## Intent Detection

**Required:**
- **User email:** Identify the user's email address (e.g., "john.doe@company.com", "what did user@example.com work on", "my activity" → use current user's email if known)
- If no email provided: Ask "Please provide the email address of the user whose activity you want to discover."

**Optional parameters:**
- **Time period:** "last 7 days", "past 30 days", "last month", "this week" → map to `daysBack`
  - Default: 7 days

## Tool Call Format

**IMPORTANT:** Use exactly this operation name and input format:

```
AzureDevOpsTool.Execute("DiscoverUserActivity", {"userEmail": "user@example.com", "daysBack": 14})
```

**Input schema (only these two fields):**
- `userEmail` (string, required): The user's email address
- `daysBack` (int, optional): Number of days to look back, default 7

**Do NOT include any other fields** like `activityTypes`, `scope`, `pageSize`, etc. - they are not supported.

## Output Format

Present results grouped by activity type in a clear, readable format:

### Pull Requests Created by {User} (Last {N} Days)
| PR ID | Title | Status | Repository | Target Branch | Created Date |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1234 | Add new feature | Active | my-repo | main | 2026-01-21 |

## Summary Statistics

After the tables, provide a brief summary:

**Activity Summary:**
- Pull Requests Created: N pull requests (in last N days)

## Edge Cases

- **User not found:** The query may return empty results; report this clearly.
- **Empty email:** Ask the user to provide an email address before proceeding.

## Future Activity Types

The following activity types are planned but not yet implemented:
- Pull requests reviewed
- Pull requests commented on
- Commits and pushes
- Wiki/documentation changes
- Build and release activity
- OneDrive/SharePoint documents
- Teams messages and mentions

When users request these, respond: "That activity type is not yet supported. Currently, I can discover pull requests created."
