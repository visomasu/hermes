Discover and summarize user activity across Azure DevOps and integrated services, including work items assigned to, changed by, and created by a specific user, as well as pull requests created by the user.

## Intent Detection

**Required:**
- **User email:** Identify the user's email address (e.g., "john.doe@company.com", "what did user@example.com work on", "my activity" → use current user's email if known)
- If no email provided: Ask "Please provide the email address of the user whose activity you want to discover."

**Optional parameters:**
- **Time period:** "last 7 days", "past 30 days", "last month", "this week" → map to `daysBack`
  - Default: 7 days
- **Activity types:** "assigned to me", "items I changed", "items I created", "my pull requests", "all activity"
  - Default: all work item activity (assigned + changed + created)
  - Can combine: "assigned items and my pull requests"
- **Work item types:** "only bugs", "tasks and user stories", "features"
- **States:** "active items", "closed items", "new items"
- **PR statuses:** "active PRs", "completed PRs", "abandoned PRs"
- **Repositories:** "repo-name" - filter PRs to specific repositories

## Tool Operations

Use `AzureDevOpsTool` with operation `DiscoverUserActivity`:

**All work item activity (default):**
```json
{
  "userEmail": "user@example.com",
  "daysBack": 7,
  "activityTypes": "AllWorkItems"
}
```

**Specific activity types:**
```json
{
  "userEmail": "user@example.com",
  "daysBack": 14,
  "activityTypes": "WorkItemsAssigned, WorkItemsChanged"
}
```

**With filtering options:**
```json
{
  "userEmail": "user@example.com",
  "daysBack": 30,
  "activityTypes": "AllWorkItems",
  "workItemOptions": {
    "states": ["Active", "New"],
    "workItemTypes": ["Bug", "Task", "User Story"]
  }
}
```

**Pull request activity:**
```json
{
  "userEmail": "user@example.com",
  "daysBack": 14,
  "activityTypes": "PullRequestsCreated"
}
```

**Pull requests with filters:**
```json
{
  "userEmail": "user@example.com",
  "daysBack": 30,
  "activityTypes": "PullRequestsCreated",
  "pullRequestOptions": {
    "statuses": ["Active", "Completed"],
    "repositories": ["my-repo", "other-repo"]
  }
}
```

**Combined work items and pull requests:**
```json
{
  "userEmail": "user@example.com",
  "daysBack": 7,
  "activityTypes": "AllWorkItems, PullRequestsCreated"
}
```

**Activity Type Values:**
- `WorkItemsAssigned` - Work items currently assigned to the user
- `WorkItemsChanged` - Work items changed by the user within the time period
- `WorkItemsCreated` - Work items created by the user within the time period
- `AllWorkItems` - All of the above work item types
- `PullRequestsCreated` - Pull requests created by the user within the time period

## Output Format

Present results grouped by activity type in a clear, readable format:

### Work Items Assigned to {User}
| ID | Title | Type | State | Area Path |
|----|-------|------|-------|-----------|
| 123 | Fix login bug | Bug | Active | Project\Team |

### Work Items Changed by {User} (Last {N} Days)
| ID | Title | Type | State | Changed Date |
|----|-------|------|-------|--------------|
| 456 | Add feature X | User Story | Active | 2026-01-22 |

### Work Items Created by {User} (Last {N} Days)
| ID | Title | Type | State | Created Date |
|----|-------|------|-------|--------------|
| 789 | New task | Task | New | 2026-01-20 |

### Pull Requests Created by {User} (Last {N} Days)
| PR ID | Title | Status | Repository | Target Branch | Created Date |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1234 | Add new feature | Active | my-repo | main | 2026-01-21 |

## Summary Statistics

After the tables, provide a brief summary:

**Activity Summary:**
- Assigned: X work items
- Changed: Y work items (in last N days)
- Created: Z work items (in last N days)
- Pull Requests Created: N pull requests (in last N days)

## Edge Cases

- **No activity found:** Report "No work items found for {activity type} in the specified period."
- **User not found:** The query may return empty results; report this clearly.
- **Large result sets:** If results exceed 50 items per category, note that results may be truncated.
- **Empty email:** Ask the user to provide an email address before proceeding.

## Future Activity Types

The following activity types are planned but not yet implemented:
- Pull requests reviewed
- Pull requests commented on
- Commits and pushes
- Wiki/documentation changes
- Build and release activity
- OneDrive/SharePoint documents
- Teams messages and mentions

When users request these, respond: "That activity type is not yet supported. Currently, I can discover work item activity (assigned, changed, created) and pull requests created."
