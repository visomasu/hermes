Remove user from daily SLA violation notification list.

## Trigger
User requests: "unregister from SLA", "stop SLA notifications", "disable SLA alerts", "I don't want SLA reports", "turn off SLA notifications"

## Process

**1. Identify User Intent**
Parse user input for unregistration keywords. Confirm intent if ambiguous to avoid accidental unregistration.

**2. Execute Unregistration**

REQUIRED INPUT PARAMETERS:
- teamsUserId: MUST be provided (string, required) - get from User Context section at the top of agent.txt

Example call:
```
UserManagementTool.Execute("UnregisterSlaNotifications", {"teamsUserId": "visomasu@microsoft.com"})
```

For the current user (see User Context section), construct the input JSON as:
```json
{
  "teamsUserId": "visomasu@microsoft.com"
}
```

This automatically:
- Checks if user is currently registered
- Sets IsRegistered flag to false in UserConfiguration
- Disables SlaViolationNotifications preference
- Preserves historical registration data (for re-registration)

**3. Communicate Result**

Success:
"✅ Unregistered successfully. You will no longer receive SLA violation notifications."

Not currently registered:
"You are not currently registered for SLA notifications."

## Important Notes

**What Stops:**
- Daily scheduled SLA violation digest emails
- Automatic team aggregation (for managers)

**What Still Works:**
- On-demand SLA checks via "check my SLA violations" command
- User can re-register at any time with no data loss
- Manager's direct reports are unaffected (they still receive their own notifications if registered)

**Silent Operation:**
- Direct reports are not notified when manager unregisters
- No audit trail or notification to team members

## Re-registration

Users can re-register at any time using the RegisterSlaNotifications capability. The system will:
- Re-fetch current direct reports from Microsoft Graph
- Update stored profile with latest organizational data
- Resume daily notifications immediately

## Related Capabilities

- **RegisterSlaNotifications:** Re-enable daily SLA notifications
- **CheckSlaViolations:** Perform immediate one-time SLA check (works without registration)

## Error Handling

If unregistration fails:
"An error occurred during unregistration. Please try again later."

If user data cannot be accessed:
"Could not access your registration data. Please contact support."
