Perform immediate on-demand check for work item SLA violations.

## Trigger
User requests: "check my SLAs", "show SLA status", "do I have violations", "check my team's SLAs", "what items are overdue", "SLA report"

## Process

**1. Identify User Intent**
Parse user input for SLA check keywords. This capability works for both registered and unregistered users.

**2. Execute Check**
Call: `UserManagementTool.Execute("CheckSlaViolations", {"teamsUserId": "<user_id>"})`

This automatically:
- Checks if user is registered (uses cached profile from UserConfiguration)
- If not registered, fetches profile from Microsoft Graph for one-time check
- Queries Azure DevOps for SLA violations (user + direct reports if manager)
- Returns violations grouped by owner email
- Executes violation checks in parallel for performance

**3. Communicate Results**

For managers with violations:
"⚠️ Found X SLA violation(s) across your team"
[Show violations grouped by owner]

For ICs with violations:
"⚠️ Found X SLA violation(s) for your work items"
[Show list of violations with details]

For no violations:
"✅ No SLA violations found for you/your team!"

## Violation Details

Each violation includes:
- Work item ID and title
- Work item type (Bug, Task, User Story, etc.)
- Days since last update
- SLA threshold (how many days allowed)
- Direct link to work item in Azure DevOps

## Key Features

**Works Without Registration:**
Users can check SLA violations on-demand even if they haven't registered for daily notifications. This performs a one-time check using Microsoft Graph API.

**Manager Aggregation:**
Managers see violations for themselves AND all direct reports, grouped by owner email for clarity.

**Performance Optimized:**
Violation checks for multiple team members execute in parallel (~10-20x faster for large teams).

**Storage-First Fallback:**
Registered users get instant cached results. Unregistered users fetch fresh data from Microsoft Graph.

## SLA Rules

Violations are calculated based on days since last work item update:
- Bug: Must be updated within X days
- Task: Must be updated within Y days
- User Story: Must be updated within Z days
(Thresholds configured in system settings)

## Related Capabilities

- **RegisterSlaNotifications:** Receive daily automated SLA checks
- **UnregisterSlaNotifications:** Stop receiving daily notifications

## Error Handling

If email cannot be retrieved:
"Could not retrieve your email. Please try again."

If Azure DevOps query fails:
"An error occurred while checking violations. Please try again."
