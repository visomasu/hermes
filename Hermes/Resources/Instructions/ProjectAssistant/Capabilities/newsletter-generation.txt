Generate executive project newsletters from Azure DevOps work item hierarchies.

## Trigger
User requests: "newsletter", "initiative update", "executive summary" + work item ID

## Process

**1. Extract ID**
Parse user input for work item ID (epic/feature). If missing: "Please provide the Azure DevOps work item ID (epic or feature) you want the newsletter for."

**2. Retrieve Hierarchy**
Call: `AzureDevOpsTool.Execute("GetWorkItemTree", {"workItemId": <id>, "depth": 3})`
Include root epic/feature, child features/stories, tasks/bugs.

**3. Analyze Data**
Extract from hierarchy:
- **Project name/description:** Root work item title and description
- **Milestones:** Group child features/stories/tasks by logical phases
- **Status:** Map states → phases (New=Upcoming, Active=In Progress, Resolved/Closed=Completed)
- **Risks:** Identify Medium/High risk fields/tags
- **Dates:** Start date, target date, completion date
- **Outcomes:** Recently closed items with business value

**4. Generate Newsletter**
Use professional, executive-friendly language. Focus on business outcomes. Include work item IDs for traceability. Calculate percentages. Infer project phase from status distribution. State assumptions if data is missing. Use consistent date format within newsletter.

## Output Format

```markdown
# [Project Name] Initiative Newsletter

## Overview
[Provide a customer-focused summary of the project based on the feature/epic description. Include the current phase based on work item status.]

Example:
"Project X aims to provide authentication capabilities using Biometrics. We are currently in Phase 2: Integration."

---

## Execution Timelines & Milestones
[Extract milestones from child work items. Group by logical phases. Include target dates from work items.]

| Milestone | Target Date | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| [Milestone 1] | [Date] | [✓ Completed / ⟳ In Progress / ◯ Upcoming / ✗ Blocked] |
| [Milestone 2] | [Date] | [Status] |
| [Milestone 3] | [Date] | [Status] |

Status Legend:
- ✓ Completed (Closed/Resolved work items)
- ⟳ In Progress (Active work items)
- ◯ Upcoming (New work items)
- ✗ Blocked (work items with High risk assessment)

---

## Outcomes Since Last Newsletter
[Identify the top 3 most significant completed work items or achievements. Focus on business value and customer impact.]

• **[Outcome 1]:** [e.g., "Completed API integration with partner systems (Work Item #12345)"]

• **[Outcome 2]:** [e.g., "Reduced onboarding time by 15% through automation (Work Item #12346)"]

• **[Outcome 3]:** [e.g., "User acceptance testing initiated with 50 participants (Work Item #12347)"]

---

## Current Milestone Progress

**Current Focus:** [Identify the milestone/phase currently in progress based on Active work items.]

**Progress:** [Calculate completion percentage: (Completed items / Total items in milestone) * 100. Provide next steps based on active/upcoming work items.]

Example:
"60% complete (6 of 10 user stories closed); integration testing scheduled for next week."

---

## Risks & Mitigation Plan
[Extract risks from work items with Medium/High risk assessments. If no explicit mitigation is documented, suggest reasonable mitigation strategies based on the risk type.]

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1 from work item] | [High/Medium/Low] | [Mitigation strategy] |
| [Risk 2 from work item] | [High/Medium/Low] | [Mitigation strategy] |
| [Risk 3 from work item] | [High/Medium/Low] | [Mitigation strategy] |

If no risks are identified:
- State: "No significant risks identified at this time. Monitoring continues."
```
