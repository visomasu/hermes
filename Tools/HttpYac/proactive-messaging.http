# How to get your Teams User ID:
# 1. Start Hermes locally: dotnet run --project Hermes
# 2. Send any message to the bot in Teams (e.g., "hello")
# 3. Check Cosmos DB emulator or logs for the captured TeamsUserId
#    - Cosmos: https://localhost:8081/_explorer/index.html → ConversationReference container
#    - Logs: Look for "Captured new conversation reference for {TeamsUserId}"
# 4. Replace the teamsUserId value above with your actual ID (format: 29:...)
# 5. Execute this request to test proactive messaging
# 6. Check Teams - you should receive the message!
